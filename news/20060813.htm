		<title>pjsip.org News: Windows Mobile Port for SIP and media</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>pjsip.org News: Aug 13th, 2006</p>
		<H1>Windows Mobile&nbsp;Port</H1>
		<P>Just added&nbsp;Windows Mobile targets (WinCE, SmartPhone, PocketPC) in the Subversion trunk revision 667. 
The port is built with Microsoft Embedded VC 4, and it
should be able to target all Windows Mobile family OSes (SmartPhone,
PocketPC, or WinCE in general).</p>


<H2>Demo Application</H2>
<p>
There's a simple and stupid GUI application (pjsua_wince) which I used
for quick tests, and it can be built by opening wince_demos.vcw EVC4
workspace from pjsip-apps/build/wince-evc4 directory.
</p>
<p>
For a really quick test, you can also use the WinCE binary that I built:
<A HREF="http://www.pjsip.org/blp/pjsua_wince.exe">http://www.pjsip.org/blp/pjsua_wince.exe</A>
</p>


<p>Screenshot is here: <A HREF="http://www.pjsip.org/blp/pjsua_wince.jpg">http://www.pjsip.org/blp/pjsua_wince.jpg</A></p>

<p>
This application should run on all WinCE OSes, but the stupid GUI is
probably best to be used on devices with pen input (PDAs, XDAs).
</p>
<p>
The best way to use the application is to call the device (e.g. from
pjsua), because the WinCE application will answer incoming calls
automatically, so no UI interaction is required.
</p>
<p>
Once you're finished with testing the application, make sure that the
application has been shutdown completely by checking in the WinCe
task manager.
</p>


<H2>Demo Application Features</H2>

<H3>Codecs</H3>
<p>
  All codecs are enabled  (that's why the size is a bit large (500KB)).
  In my 320MHz ARM, only G.711 and GSM work; iLBC or Speex is just too
  much for my PDA, even when fixed point version of Speex is used.

  If you use pjsua to call the device, you should add --add-codec option
  to specify which particular codec to be used, because by default pjsua
  uses speex/16000 codec.
</p>

<H3>Echo Canceller</H3>
<p>
  Simple echo suppressor is used instead of the AEC, but still it's quite
  effective. Some echo may still come through, but this is intentional,
  to tolerate some cross talk.
</p>

<H3>PLC</H3>
<p>  The simple replay based Packet lost concealment (PLC) is used.</p>

<H3>SIP Features</H3>
<p>  No, there isn't any (not even registration). Just a simple call.</p>

<p>Apart from that, all other features should be available.</p>

<p>The website or mailing list archives may have some more info on this.</P>
