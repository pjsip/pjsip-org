		<H1>SIP norefersub (RFC 4488) Support</H1>
		<P>Just added support for norefersub RFC 4488) in the Subversion 
		   trunk revision 688 of PJSUA-LIB. In this implementation, incoming REFER with
		   norefersub tag will cause PJSUA to suppress implicit subscription that is normally
		   created for incoming REFER. However,
	           there is currently no way to request norefersub for outgoing REFER request
                   in PJSUA-LIB (this will be implemented soon).</P>

		<p>Please see some details in the website or mailing list archives.</P>
